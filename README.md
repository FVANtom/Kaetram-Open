## Backstory

The world of Terra died.. Years of pollution and neglect killing it slowly. Its population fleeing, until nothing was left. Or so we thought..

Something stirs.. a new wind blows.. the spirits are awakening, bringing with them new life..

But Terra still needs help. The spirits need guidance. They need you!
Answer their call and bind your soul with them to embark on the greatest quest of all.

Save the world! Restore life!

## The spirit of collaboration

Spirits of Terra (SOT) is based on the open-source Kaetram game engine.
In the same spirit (pun intended) we will also create a big portion of our project with the same open-source license.

Partly because we strive to form a symbiotic relationship with the Kaetram project so we can share updates and fixes both ways.
And partly to allow members of our community to help build the game.

Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/E8M5gPC) for more information about helping out with development.

Consider supporting the Kaetram project. Without them, we would not exist. More information can be found inside their repo https://github.com/Kaetram/Kaetram-Open

## Get Started

TODO once we have set up the details to run the open source part stand alone and made mocks for our closed source code we will update this section.

## Ideas and wishes

### In-game world editor

A world editor which is available to every player and with which players can submit suggestions for changes to the world. Those suggested changes will be vetted and approved by a team of moderators.
Instead of building separate admin tools for this, we would like to have it as an integral part of the gameplay.
